## Project Status Board

- [x] Enable normal CSS (CSS Modules) alongside Tailwind CSS in the project
  - Success criteria: Can import and use a CSS module in a component, and styles are applied as expected.
- [ ] Implement responsive design improvements for the Themes section
  - Success criteria: All screen sizes display content appropriately with proper spacing and proportions

## Background and Motivation

The current responsive design implementation for the Themes section needs improvement. While the 768px layout has a good design style, as screen sizes get larger, the box sizes and spacing need better control. We need to revise the CSS to ensure content remains visually balanced across all screen sizes while maintaining the graphic placeholder as the main focal point.

## Key Challenges and Analysis

Based on the screenshots provided across different device widths (425px, 768px, 1024px, 1440px, 2560px), the following issues were identified:

1. **Mobile View (425px)**: 
   - Text elements (list items) are properly stacked but could use better vertical spacing
   - ThemesXtraInfoText box at the bottom has appropriate padding but lacks visual distinction

2. **Tablet View (768px)**:
   - Good layout overall - this is the reference design we want to maintain
   - List items and info text have balanced proportions

3. **Small Desktop (1024px)**:
   - The boxes begin to stretch too wide horizontally
   - Content starts to lose its cohesion with the graphic element

4. **Medium Desktop (1440px)**:
   - Excessive space between elements
   - Boxes become too large relative to their content
   - Text starts to feel disconnected from the main graphic

5. **Large Desktop (2560px)**:
   - Layout breaks down completely with too much empty space
   - Text boxes are disproportionately large
   - Poor visual hierarchy with the main graphic

## High-level Task Breakdown

1. **Revise Container Layout Strategy**
   - Implement max-width constraints for the ThemesContainer at larger breakpoints
   - Use flexbox or grid more effectively to maintain proportional layouts
   - Success criteria: Container maintains appropriate width across all screen sizes

2. **Improve Box Sizing and Spacing**
   - Modify ThemesXtraInfo element to use percentage-based widths with max-width constraints
   - Implement more granular breakpoints for smoother transitions
   - Success criteria: Boxes maintain appropriate proportions relative to their content

3. **Enhance Text Presentation**
   - Remove box containers for list items at larger screen sizes
   - Use a more minimal approach for text presentation on larger screens
   - Implement subtle visual cues to connect text with the main graphic
   - Success criteria: Text remains readable and visually connected to content at all screen sizes

4. **Optimize Main Graphic Prominence**
   - Adjust the size and positioning of the ThemesGraphic to make it the clear focal point
   - Use visual design techniques (shadows, borders, etc.) to enhance its prominence
   - Success criteria: The graphic remains the main visual element at all screen sizes

5. **Improve Visual Hierarchy for Larger Screens**
   - Implement a different layout strategy for screens larger than 1440px
   - Consider a grid-based approach with fixed column widths
   - Success criteria: Content maintains visual balance on ultra-wide screens

## Implementation Strategy

For each screen size category, we'll implement the following specific improvements:

### Mobile (< 768px)
- Keep the current stacked layout
- Slightly reduce the gap between list items (0.5rem)
- Add subtle visual distinction to the ThemesXtraInfoText box

### Tablet (768px - 1023px)
- Maintain current layout as our reference design
- Ensure consistent spacing and proportions

### Small Desktop (1024px - 1439px)
- Implement max-width constraint on ThemesContainer (90% with max-width: 1200px)
- Convert to a two-column grid layout with fixed proportions
- Place graphic on left, text content on right
- Remove box containers for list items, use simple list styling

### Medium Desktop (1440px - 2559px)
- Maintain the two-column grid layout
- Further constrain max-width (80% with max-width: 1400px)
- Increase graphic size relative to text content
- Use more whitespace strategically between elements

### Large Desktop (2560px+)
- Use a centered, constrained layout (max-width: 1800px)
- Increase font size but maintain compact layout
- Consider a more horizontal arrangement of content
- Minimize decorative elements that create visual noise

## Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests

- Created `page.module.css` and imported it in `page.tsx` to resolve the `styles` reference errors.
- Added basic styles for the NavBar and its elements in the CSS module.
- You can now use both Tailwind utility classes (in your JSX) and normal CSS (via CSS modules or global CSS) in your project.
- Please manually verify that the NavBar displays with the expected styles. If you want to use global CSS, add styles to `globals.css`. For component-scoped styles, create and import a `.module.css` file as shown.

## Lessons
- To use normal CSS with Tailwind in Next.js, use CSS modules for component-scoped styles and import them as objects (e.g., `import styles from './Component.module.css'`).
- Tailwind and normal CSS can coexist; Tailwind is processed via PostCSS, and CSS modules are handled by Next.js.
