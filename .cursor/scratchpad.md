## Background and Motivation

The current responsive design implementation for the Themes section needs improvement. While the 768px layout has a good design style, as screen sizes get larger, the box sizes and spacing need better control. We need to revise the CSS to ensure content remains visually balanced across all screen sizes while maintaining the graphic placeholder as the main focal point.

Additionally, the Community Container needs proper visibility handling to ensure its content is hidden when the container is collapsed and appears with smooth animations when expanded.

The client has also requested changes to the accordion functionality. Both sections should be permanently open, and the ToDoItems should expand on click with only one being active at a time. The "Every day, we're rewarding great storytelling..." content should be moved to the expanded panel for the "Daily Content Challenge" item.

## Key Challenges and Analysis

Based on the screenshots provided across different device widths (425px, 768px, 1024px, 1440px, 2560px), the following issues were identified:

1. **Mobile View (425px)**: 
   - Text elements (list items) are properly stacked but could use better vertical spacing
   - ThemesXtraInfoText box at the bottom has appropriate padding but lacks visual distinction

2. **Tablet View (768px)**:
   - Good layout overall - this is the reference design we want to maintain
   - List items and info text have balanced proportions

3. **Small Desktop (1024px)**:
   - The boxes begin to stretch too wide horizontally
   - Content starts to lose its cohesion with the graphic element

4. **Medium Desktop (1440px)**:
   - Excessive space between elements
   - Boxes become too large relative to their content
   - Text starts to feel disconnected from the main graphic

5. **Large Desktop (2560px)**:
   - Layout breaks down completely with too much empty space
   - Text boxes are disproportionately large
   - Poor visual hierarchy with the main graphic

## High-level Task Breakdown

1. ✅ **Revise Container Layout Strategy**
   - Implemented max-width constraints for the ThemesContainer at larger breakpoints
   - Used flexbox and grid layouts more effectively to maintain proportional layouts
   - Success criteria met: Container maintains appropriate width across all screen sizes

2. ✅ **Improve Box Sizing and Spacing**
   - Modified ThemesXtraInfo element to use percentage-based widths with max-width constraints
   - Implemented more granular breakpoints for smoother transitions
   - Success criteria met: Boxes maintain appropriate proportions relative to their content

3. ✅ **Enhance Text Presentation**
   - Removed box containers for list items at larger screen sizes
   - Used a more minimal approach for text presentation on larger screens
   - Implemented subtle visual cues (dots, borders) to connect text with the main graphic
   - Success criteria met: Text remains readable and visually connected to content at all screen sizes

4. ✅ **Optimize Main Graphic Prominence**
   - Adjusted the size and positioning of the ThemesGraphic to make it the clear focal point
   - Used visual design techniques (shadows, borders, etc.) to enhance its prominence
   - Success criteria met: The graphic remains the main visual element at all screen sizes

5. ✅ **Improve Visual Hierarchy for Larger Screens**
   - Implemented a different layout strategy for screens larger than 1440px
   - Used a grid-based approach with fixed column widths
   - Success criteria met: Content maintains visual balance on ultra-wide screens

6. **Remove Accordion Functionality**
   - ✅ Remove accordion button functionality
   - ✅ Make both sections permanently visible
   - Success criteria: Both "Pitch Your Dream" and "Learn. Earn. Build." sections are always visible

7. **Implement Expandable ToDoItems**
   - ✅ Add click functionality to ToDoItems
   - ✅ Create expandable content panels
   - ✅ Move "Every day, we're rewarding great storytelling..." content to the Daily Content Challenge panel
   - ✅ Ensure only one ToDoItem can be active at a time
   - Success criteria: Clicking on a ToDoItem shows its expanded content and closes any previously open item

## Implementation Strategy

Implemented specific improvements for each screen size category:

### Mobile (< 768px)
- Kept the stacked layout but improved spacing
- Reduced gap between list items to 0.5rem
- Added subtle visual distinction to the ThemesXtraInfoText box
- Ensured container height adapts to content

### Tablet (768px - 1023px)
- Maintained the reference design but improved proportions
- Added width constraints for better content containment
- Balanced the space between elements

### Small Desktop (1024px - 1439px)
- Implemented a two-column grid layout with title spanning both columns
- Placed graphic on left, text content on right
- Removed box containers for list items in favor of simpler styling
- Improved text alignment and readability

### Medium Desktop (1440px - 2559px)
- Enhanced the two-column grid layout
- Added visual elements to connect list items (dots, borders)
- Improved spacing between elements
- Made the graphic more prominent

### Large Desktop (2560px+)
- Implemented a constrained layout with maximum width
- Used larger font sizes while maintaining compact spacing
- Added visual elements (dots, left borders) to enhance hierarchy
- Created a more balanced horizontal arrangement

## Lessons
- To use normal CSS with Tailwind in Next.js, use CSS modules for component-scoped styles and import them as objects (e.g., `import styles from './Component.module.css'`).
- Tailwind and normal CSS can coexist; Tailwind is processed via PostCSS, and CSS modules are handled by Next.js. 
- For responsive design, use a reference design (like the 768px layout) and adapt it to different screen sizes with appropriate constraints.
- On larger screens, simpler styling often looks better than boxed elements.
- Use grid layouts for better control over content placement at different screen sizes.
- Visual elements like dots and borders can help maintain hierarchy without using boxes.
- For smooth animations when showing/hiding content:
  - Use a combination of opacity, transform, and size transitions
  - Apply staggered delays to create a nice flow of elements appearing
  - Use attribute selectors to conditionally style elements based on their state
  - Set overflow to hidden to prevent content from appearing outside its container 
- When implementing expandable items, use state management to ensure only one item is active at a time
- Use CSS transitions and animations to create smooth user experiences when showing/hiding content
