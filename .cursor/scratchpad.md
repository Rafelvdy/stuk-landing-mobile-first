## Project Status Board

- [x] Enable normal CSS (CSS Modules) alongside Tailwind CSS in the project
  - Success criteria: Can import and use a CSS module in a component, and styles are applied as expected.

## Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests

- Created `page.module.css` and imported it in `page.tsx` to resolve the `styles` reference errors.
- Added basic styles for the NavBar and its elements in the CSS module.
- You can now use both Tailwind utility classes (in your JSX) and normal CSS (via CSS modules or global CSS) in your project.
- Please manually verify that the NavBar displays with the expected styles. If you want to use global CSS, add styles to `globals.css`. For component-scoped styles, create and import a `.module.css` file as shown.

## Lessons
- To use normal CSS with Tailwind in Next.js, use CSS modules for component-scoped styles and import them as objects (e.g., `import styles from './Component.module.css'`).
- Tailwind and normal CSS can coexist; Tailwind is processed via PostCSS, and CSS modules are handled by Next.js.
